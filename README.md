# JourneyinCloud
JourneyinCloud is a relaxing game or probably an interactive web. Music and some special visual effects are integrated into it.

There are several different scenes in this game, you can jump from one scene to another one by pressing the keyboard. And these three yellow clouds are designed to control the music. To play with the cloud to control the music is Just like you are a music DJ. If players pull up the cloud, and the corresponding music or sound will become louder. So what you will interact with the clouds is like pull up and down the cloud to remix music. And, not only the sound changes when you change the position of the cloud, it will also triggle some different/ special and surprising animation in the scene. 

So the game is not like the typical game because you will not win or lose. It has no goals. What I want you to do is just you are willing to spend time in this music interaction, enter and stay in the small world I built to explore different audio and visual possibilities by moving the clouds.

I hope JourneyinCloud can give you a good visual and audio enjoyment and feel relaxing. This is what I want to achieve no matter who you are, just simply play in this music world and feel enjoyment and satisfaction!
